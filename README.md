# ByX Protocol Comprehensive Testing Suite

---

## Overview

---

> This repository contains a comprehensive testing suite for the **ByX Platform** by **NexArt Protocol**. The goal is to systematically validate every documented function, constant, variable, and feature in the ByX Protocol v1.0.0 execution environment.

---

## Contents

---

- **Kitchen Sink Test Sketch** - A complete validation sketch that exercises every documented API feature at least once. Includes all stub functions and constant definitions required to achieve successful execution
- **Comprehensive Error Report** - Detailed documentation of all implementation gaps and workarounds

---

## Purpose

---

> This testing suite was created to:

1. Validate actual implementation against documented specifications
2. Identify missing functions, constants, and features
3. Document workarounds for production use
4. Provide feedback to the NexArt team for platform improvements

---

## Key Findings

---

- **22 critical implementation gaps** identified
- **100% test coverage** of documented API surface
- **All errors successfully remediated** through user-defined implementations and stubs

---

## Test Coverage

---

> ✅ All 10 VAR protocol variables  
> ✅ All drawing primitives and variations  
> ✅ All style and color functions  
> ✅ All transform functions  
> ✅ All random and noise functions  
> ✅ All math utilities and constants  
> ✅ All text functions  
> ✅ Pixel manipulation system (non-functional but crash-free)  
> ✅ Both Static and Loop execution modes

---

## Usage

---

> The test sketch is designed to run in the ByX environment and will execute without errors despite the documented implementation gaps. All necessary workarounds are included at the start of the `setup()` function.
