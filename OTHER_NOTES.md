- The DEFAULT input boxes for the VARs arent rendering so that the values are visible.
- Contract deployed, but when I tried to mint I recieved this error; 'Canonical render failed: 500 - {"error":"EXECUTION_ERROR","message":"mode.toUpperCase is not a function"}'.
- Minting of 'Dots by A by Arrotu' worked with zero issues. Image hash: 9f69675d474728ce764950635694ff9498efa93e6401c1f82451415cf1e20b6a, snapshot hash: f5081cb83abe51c205428d8b82e12a7ada2ea6b4f1cc9729c7ddbe89b6c9cc79.
